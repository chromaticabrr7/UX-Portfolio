            <div class="body-text">Knowing the ‘why’ meant efforts could be focused on helping users better achieve their goals. Having looked at where users struggled during user tests, pain points were revealed in the following areas:
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-item">The current one page solution for the homepage is cluttered and not intuitive, thereby reducing productivity.</li>
                    <li class="list-item">Searching for information and tips quickly is tedious and often leads to frustration and giving up.</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="subheading extrasmall-top-spacing">A rebuilt Information Architecture meant faster, more intuitive navigation.</div>
            <div class="body-text small-top-spacing">Looking at the information architecture of the existing app it was clear the single homepage failed to establish an hierarchy that prioritized the most important information and functions. Reserving the homepage for priority functions alone while moving secondary functions to another page meant there would be less visual clutter. Information could be navigated to without too much delay. </div>

            <div class="slide-heading-secondary medium-top-spacing">Overhauling the Search Function provided the user with immediate feedback.</div>
            <div class="body-text">Letting the user know that the app was following their search decisions was a crucial mode of feedback. The lack of feedback in the current app led to users often quitting their search all together. Auto populating search results and search query suggestions needed to be implemented. A bookmarking feature would allow users to save sources of information most relevant to them.</div>
            <div class="slide-heading-secondary medium-top-spacing">A new visual language represented reliable safety information, hence a confident user.</div>
            <div class="body-text">The existing visual language didn't portray a reliable information resource, ultimately leading to users looking elsewhere for information. Implementing predictability and clearly communicating information through visual cues and a familiar user interface came down to the following:
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-item">A bolder, more spaced out layout with larger, clearly labeled and colored buttons (taps, fields).</li>
                    <li class="list-item">A tabbed interface splitting the app into two areas, separating priority resources (hazard form and safety numbers) from secondary functions (searching and bookmarking topics).</li>
                    <li class="list-item">Clear highlighting of warning labels to differentiate between casual and emergency use cases.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="slide-heading-secondary medium-top-spacing">An updated flow provided guidance throughout prototyping and validation.</div>
            <div class="body-text">Laying out and wireframing an updated flow meant the recalibrated Information Architecture could be put to action. New interactions could be experimented with in order to gauge overall intuitiveness. Wireframes could also be shared with others to receive feedback.</div>

            <div class="body-text small-top-spacing">The prototype encompassed most of what I had attempted to accomplish throughout the design process. Larger tiles on the home screen provided access to important information, made easily accessible for urgent situations. This anchored the primary function of the app while the search feature offered personalization and a home for more casual use. The two-tab build also meant future iterations could expand on this layout in a modular form.</div>

            <div class="slide-heading-secondary small-top-spacing">Focusing on simplicity.</div>
            <div class="body-text">The redesign was a blank slate that could have been taken in many directions. I found myself envisioning multiple feature sets and visual approaches early on in the process and at a certain point had to step back and reevaluate what the app was being redesigned for. It took some time but reframing my approach to "making the existing experience, function and form, easier" was a key factor in completing this project.</div>
            <div class="slide-heading-secondary small-top-spacing">There is more work to do.</div>
            <div class="body-text">One of the areas that still bugs me is the article view. When a user selects an article from a search, the current app displays the article as a document, like viewing a pdf. Zooming in is required to even read the documents. To come up with an all-encompassing solution to displaying documents would require accessing every document made available within the app, across multiple locals. This is a problem that is going to require more thought so I'll let you know when I've cracked it.</div>
