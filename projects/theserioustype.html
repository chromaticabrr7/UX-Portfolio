Users can get a high level glimpse of the content populating their areas of interest while circumventing the infinite scroll that so often contributes to mindless engagement. Less opportunity for scrolling means more time for doing.</div>

            <div class="slide-heading">Something to Show</div>
            <div class="body-text">A platform that had a simple website and wealthy vision but struggled with retention now has a mobile concept to back that vision. As funding is one of the client’s primary concerns in establishing longevity, this project has provided them with a proof-of-concept to showcase amongst potential donors. Funding opens the door to development and eventually, a marketable product.</div>

            <div class="slide-heading">Phase Two</div>
            <div class="body-text">This eight week project was always structured around researching and building an experimental concept that could possibly be brought into development given it was approved by the client. There was never any certainty that the team would be moving forward. That being said, the deliverables have garnered a lot of support on the stakeholder side and it is expected that the project will be moving into its second phase in short order.</div>
            <div class="slide-heading-secondary small-top-spacing">Validating What We've Got</div>
            <div class="body-text">Given the time constraints there was little opportunity for the most recent iteration of our prototype to be tested amongst users. To kick off research and design efforts in the next phase it is expected that a test plan will be put together to acquire a complete set of qualitative information. An analysis will be performed and personas will be referenced accordingly to determine how we can better satisfy our core user needs.</div>
            <div class="slide-heading-secondary small-top-spacing">What is Meaningful Mentorship?</div>
            <div class="body-text">Again, due to time, the concept of mentorship was left only partially addressed in the app’s design. This was also partly due to a lack of qualitative information on mentor-mentee relationships. Exploration in this area is necessary and will be made a high priority item during phase two.</div>
